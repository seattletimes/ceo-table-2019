          A new federal regulation requires public companies to report the ratio between their median employee’s pay and the CEO’s total compensation. Companies must report their pay ratios within 120 days of the end of their fiscal years -- a deadline that has yet to arrive for some companies with fiscal years that don't align with calendar years.
